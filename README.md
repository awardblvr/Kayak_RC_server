# Kayak_RC_server

Just my private code for an ESP32 based remote control for my Kayak motor (brushed DC PWM controlled trolling motor) - (Newport Vessles 36 Lb thrust Kayak motor)

Uses Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT for Remote, Adafruit Huzzah Feather ESP32 for Server (In battery pack). Uses ESPNOW communication. Reduced WiFi power to 2nd lowest setting. Turns off Wifi after sending (+ brief wait period for responses).

Its experimental.. not intrended for public consumption.. Its a work in progress. Messy messy messy!

This is the motor c ontrol code that goes in the battery pack.
